# English Schools

I was struggling to find a website where I can compare the ratings and performance of schools in England - ok there is the government one but it is not so friendly to navigate. This is my attempt at bringing the Ofsted ratings and schools performance into one place that is not bloated with a million different pieces of information.<br><br>

Written in **Dash** that predominately uses **datatables** showing data for each of the 3 main phases of education (primary, secondar and post 16). Data includes:
  - primary: reading, writing & maths
  - secondary: progress 8, attainment 8, eng/maths passes
  - post16: average A-level grade<br><br>
